# Minawiki

An light wiki-comment engine.

By using Minawiki you can create a wiki tree in which each node is a wiki entry. Under each entry users are allowed to leave comments anonymously. Comments could be liked. Users could also rate an entry anonymously. The rating could be shown for evaluating the item or be used to sort entries in the same depth.

The idea of Minawiki is focused on anonymous rate and anonymous comment. The front-end design of Minawiki should be correspond with it.

## Application Scenarios

This project is originally designed for the neu course wiki, where students can comment on courses. The aim of neu course wiki is to build a community that can provide a reference for students when they sign up for courses.

Another application scenario is major, similar to course.
